Hi, I'm Molly. I'm a designer currently living and working in Chicago at Opternative. 
When I'm not working, you can find me practicing yoga, eating pizza, talking about 
podcasts, reading feminist blogs, hanging with the best of Chicago's design 
community, or going on a random adventure. I'm currently taking on small 
freelance projects. Contact me if you're interested in working together.
